# COS341-Semester-Project




HOW TO RUN:

(Run basicify.py with Python. input.spl is the student language you want to compile. program.bas is the output (BASIC code))
```python basicify.py input.spl program.bas```

(This one you need to pip install the pcbasic thing - this will take the program.bas BASIC code and run it and put the output in program.out.txt)
```pcbasic --run=program.bas --output=program.out.txt --quit```
